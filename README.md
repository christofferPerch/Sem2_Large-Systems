# 2nd Semester Large Systems

This project aims to develop software for a chemical storage depot to ensure compliance with EU and UK health and safety regulations. The system will manage the storage, movement, and tracking of hazardous chemicals, monitor warehouse capacities, and ensure legal requirements for handling volatile substances are met. Additionally, it will provide real-time alerts in case of emergencies, audit data for regulatory compliance, and integrate with external services like the fire department.

We will use the GitHub Project board and issues to organize and track the project's progress. The board is structured with columns for backlog, in progress, in review, done, and bugs. User stories will be added as issues, with some potentially split into smaller tasks based on their size. We'll label tasks based on estimated effort: Small (less than 4 hours), Medium (4-8 hours), and Large (more than 8 hours). An "Important" label will be used to prioritize critical tasks.
